          Our mission is to promote sustainable tourism in India through homestays and create opportunities for people to learn and earn in their villages.

          Not only do we provide the alternate livelihood to the host families but also support the local communities that help reducing migration from villages. In addition to engaging local staff and using local resources, we train the women in various aspects of hospitality like guest handling, cooking, hygiene, adopting eco-practices etc. The youth of the area are also trained in tourism activities so they get the employment opportunities in the village itself and do not have to go to the cities in search of jobs. We work actively with locals to create outlets for local produce and handicrafts to boost the local economy.
